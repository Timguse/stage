    The first input array is the key to the correct answers to
    an exam, like ["a", "a", "b", "d"]. The second one contains
    a student's submitted answers.

    The two arrays are not empty and are the same length. Return
    the score for this array of answers, giving +4 for each
    correct answer, -1 for each incorrect answer, and +0
    for each blank answer, represented as an empty string
    (in C the space character is used).
